              Think of these concepts as an encycolpedia library.<br>
            In using this library you have physical books that contain data.<br>
            These physical books can be viewed as the <b>DISK</b>.<br>
            In order to access the <b>DISK</b> you must physically take them from the shelf, open to a certain page, and locate a topic.<br>
            This process can be considered <b>MEMORY</b>.<br>
            The <b>MEMORY</b> can be thought of as a bookmarker; a temporary, fluid hold on a page or topic.<br>
            In order to make use of the bookmarked data it must be processed.<br>
            In this example we use our eyes and brain as the <b>CPU</b> to read and comprehend the data.<br>
